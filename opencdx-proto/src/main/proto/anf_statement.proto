 * "Indeterminate" indicates a measure that can range from 0 to some value greater than 0.
 * "Exact Value" signifies a measure where a certain quantity is a precise value. Both `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` are set to this exact value with `include_lower_bound` and `include_upper_bound` set to true.
 * "Ranges" represent a measure that falls within a particular range. The `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` are set to the extremities of this range with `include_lower_bound` and `include_upper_bound` set based on context.
 * `semantic` describes the semantical sense of the measure, e.g., "Countable quantity".
